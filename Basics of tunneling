Network tunneling 
It insures that connection between two devices is encrypted.
basically the data will be send encapsulated and encrypted to the end device.

types of tunneling / protocol

Virtual private network (VPN) tunnel. 
Secure Shell (SSH) tunnel. 
Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) 
Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) 
Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) 
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) 
Split tunneling 


wht is actully working 
So, when L2TP is used in conjunction with IPsec, it means that L2TP is responsible for establishing the tunnel,
while IPsec is responsible for adding the necessary security measures to protect the data being transmitted through
that tunnel.This combination is often referred to as "L2TP/IPsec."



Local VPN tunelling 

LVT means creating local host server ( within the phone) , and bypass all the trafic through the created local server like VPN 
and through that we can emmbed many stratigies to avoid suspicious URLs or IP or any other stuffs  

VPN tunneling refers to the process of creating a secure, encrypted communication channel, or "tunnel," over an existing network connection, typically the internet. 
This tunnel is established between a client device (such as your computer or smartphone) and a VPN server. The purpose of VPN tunneling is to ensure the privacy, 
security, and anonymity of your internet traffic as it travels between your device and the VPN server.
